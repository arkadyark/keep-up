# keep-up
Made at McHacks 2016.

The current messaging space is diluted. Most people chat on more than a couple of platforms (SMS, Messenger, WhatsApp, Telegram, WeChat) and in far too many group messages. When something meaningful is shared, it frequently gets lots in the constant flow of messaging we all participate in daily.
This project aims to be a platform-agnostic way to keep links separate from fast-moving chats so they can be properly consumed.
